Boanca Ionut Silviu
Jul 2020 - Oct 2020

This is the first website builded and deployed by myself with the knowledge acquired from the course taken at The Informal School of IT. Ionut is a friend of mine and I`ve enjoyed working for him so he can be closer to his dream of becoming a personal coach. This project maintained my focus on learning web development technologies. I did it whith passion.
